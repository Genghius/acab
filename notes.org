Agent architecture

sense: inputs:
1) data assertions from the world
2) data assertions from the last act if a closed model

reason: select next action
run rules,
propose actions
select action


act: 
1) output instructions to world
2) assert new facts if closed model


--------------------
Simplest form:
assert data
choose random action (that conditions match)
assert actions


--------------------
Rules -> alpha network
Construct a condition trie, as a second dimension of the fact trie
hash exit points, create tokens, then run beta on demand?
