* Agent architecture


** Sense: inputs:
 1) data assertions from the world
 2) data assertions from the last act if a closed model
** Reason: select next action
   run rules,
   propose actions
   score actions
   select action
** Act:
 1) output instructions to world
 2) assert new facts if closed model
** Thoughts:
 Rules -> alpha network
 Construct a condition trie, as a second dimension of the fact trie
 hash exit points, create tokens, then run beta on demand?
